1st test:
=========
take libintermediate.so
one of the dynamic entries would point to start of libc.so or something like that
create one more dynamic entry in the beginning of the stack that would point to   ibc.so or bc.so or just c.so
hence extra dependency added which is c.so before libc.so

we create the c.so and put it in the path. the loader searches symbols in c.so before searching in libc.so

2nd test:
=========
take an app and see if we are able to pack another c.so file inside the apk and whether the app can find it in some way.
it doesnt matter if the folder is searched before or after the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
